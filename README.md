# Network
This test is meant to gauge how well you understand and use Ansible to deploy Docker containers. It is necessary that you make a template file, store it in GitHub, and use Ansible to launch Docker containers in accordance with the guidelines.

For this evaluation, create a public GitHub repository.
Use Ansible to deploy a Docker container that is running the Apache service and displaying a static webpage.

Set up the container such that it can communicate with the network and confirm that it can be accessed from the host computer.
To illustrate the container operating on the 172.168.10.0/30 subnet, create a network diagram. On the container subnet, traffic from the host machine should be permitted.
